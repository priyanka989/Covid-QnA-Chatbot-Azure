# Azure Cognitive Language Services

## Azure Content Moderator

1. **Intro**

   Azure content moderator is a service that helps detect potentially abusive, non-appropriate content in text, videos and photos. But this service only detects the data that potentially needs moderation. It doesn't modify the data, eg. replace abusive words with * or add black square to image.

   The Text Moderator returns three categories of information:

   - Profanity - list of potentially unwanted words from text. This list is named `Terms` and consists position of this word in the text. This feature is supported in over 100 languages.

   - Classification  - this feature returns information how likely the text was detected in one of the three categories:

     - Category 1 - sexually explicit content or adult content
     - Category 2 - suggestive or mature content
     -  Category 3 - offensive content.

     In the response each category gets the score between 0 and 1. If the content falls into the category the value will be closer to 1. If the content doesn't have features of the category the score will be closer to 0.

     Also classification returns the information if the text should be reviewed by human. This value is based on the thresholds of the scores.

     Classification supports only English.

   - Personal data/Personally identifiable information (PII) - this feature detects if personal data is present in the text. The personal data includes: email, IP address, US address, US phone number.

   The Azure Content Moderator is accessible by HTTP API, but I will cover that in the How to section.

2. **Use cases**

   Example use cases for Azure content moderator:

   - adding explicit label on the texts, videos, photos on the Internet (eg. in the social media, websites, forums etc.)
   - sending to moderation posts on forum containing images with nudity, sex etc.
   - moderating chats on lives (conferences, meetups, game streaming etc.)
   - moderating comments on blogs, video platforms etc.

3. **How to**
   1. Using the service

      To use the service you need to create content moderator resource using the Portal, ARM template, Azure CLI or other tool. Then you need to get Content Moderator `Subscription key`. Then using this key you can authorize to use the API of this service. You can make requests using HTTP API with header named `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`. Another option to use Azure Content Moderator is to use the official SDK. The SDKs are available for: C#/.NET, Python, Node.js, Go and Java. In this approach the `Subscription key` is used as a parameter in the SDK methods and/or classes.

## Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)

1. **Intro**

   LUIS is the natural text understanding and processing service. It allows to interpret, extract intents and phrases from natural text.

   There are three features in the natural text that LUIS identifies:

   - utterances - this is simply the user input. Eg. 'What shoe sizes are available?'
   - intents - what user wants to do. Eg. 'get shoe size'
   - entities - word or phrase that can be extracted from utterance. Eg. 'available'.

2. **Use cases**

   Example use cases for LUIS:

   - chat box on shopping site for asking about product details. First bot tries to answer those based on knowledge base, if no success it then redirects conversation to human
   - arranging visits to hairdressers, mechanics, doctors, vets, etc.
   - booking tickets for flights, trains, theaters, etc.
   - Recruitment site to find offers based on chat and booking recruitment meetings

3. **How to**
   
   1. Using the service
   
      1. To use the service you need to create Language Understanding resource using the Portal, ARM template, Azure CLI or other tool. 
   
      2. Then you need to create LUIS app in the same region that you created language understanding service. For me the nearest location is West Europe. For the Europe LUIS app navigate to this URL: [https://eu.luis.ai/](https://eu.luis.ai/).
      3. Login with your Microsoft account and create a new LUIS app. During the creation we must enter the name of the app and the culture of the app.
      4. Then we need to crate new intent. Give it a name, and provide at least five utterances for the intent.
      5. Then we need to create entities that we want LUIS to recognize. There are a few entities types: machine learned (learned from context), list (list of the values), regex (entity must match regex), Pattern.Any. Choose machine learned type.
      6. Then we need to set the entities in the utterances that we've added earlier. To do this navigate to the utterances and in each select the entity, in the sentence select words or phrases indicating the entity and select correct entity.
      7. After adding all intents, utterances and entities, we can train our LUIS model.
      8. After the training is successfully done, we can publish the app. There are two endpoints: production and staging. After publishing, we can try our LUIS app using the Test tab.
   
   2. Pricing
   
      There are two pricing tiers for LUIS:
   
      - Free
   
        The free tier comes with limitations. You can use only 5 transaction per second, up to 10 000 Text Requests transactions free per month and up to 1 Million Authoring transactions free per month. Also in the free tier speech requests are not available.
   
      - Standard
   
        Standard tier comes with limit of 50 transaction per second. Payment is for the 1 000 operations. Prices below comes from the [LUIS pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-services/):
   
        ```
        Text Requests	$1.50 per 1,000 transactions

   Text Analytics API comes with features used to extract information from text. Using Text analytics API you can:

   - detect language of the text
   - get the sentiment of the text (percent of good text emotional valence)
   - detect key words and phrases
   - get the well-known entities from text (eg. names of celebrities or politicians)

2. **Use cases**

   Example use cases for Text Analytics API:

   - checking product or service reviews if they are positive or negative.

3. **How to**
   1. Using the service

      To use the service you need to create Text Analytics resource using the Portal, ARM template, Azure CLI or other tool. Then you need to get Text Analytics API key. Then using this key you can authorize to use the API of this service, which needs to be send as a `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header as in the Azure Content Moderator API. The API URL for the West Europe region goes as follows: `https://westeurope.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/[entities/language/keyPhrases/sentiment]` the last segment of the URL is for the type of data you want to get in the response. There are 4 values presented above: entities, language, keyPhrases and sentiment.
